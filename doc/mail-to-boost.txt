DotNet FileSystemWatcher like library proposal.

Hello all,

I am working on a library like DotNet FileSystemWatcher ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.filesystemwatcher%28VS.80%29.aspx )

Basically the library monitors for file system changes and notifies throwing events.

First, it will support the following platforms:
	- Windows NT 5.0 (Windows 2000) or higher using O/I Completion Port.
	- Linux 2.6.13 or higher using inotify.
	- FreeBSD 4.1 or higher using kqueue.
	- NetBSD 2.0 or higher using kqueue.
  - OpenBSD 3.6 higher using kqueue.	(Not sure which version supports it)
	- MacOS/X 10.4 higher using kqueue. (Not sure which version supports it)

Future supported platforms:
	- Linux from 2.4.0-test9 2.6.12 using dnotify.
	- Sun OpenSolaris using FEM API.

Testing:
	I am testing the library on FreeBSD 7.2, Linux 2.6.31, Windows XP (Windows NT 5.1).
	I need help to test on older versions of these operating systems. 
	Also in NetBSD, OpenBSD and mainly on MacOSX because I do not have the necessary hardware.

I would like to include this library in Boost, I think would be useful.
What do you think? If so, I would like to have a mentor (like GSoC) and experienced in Boost development.

Thanks and regards,
Fernando Pelliccioni
